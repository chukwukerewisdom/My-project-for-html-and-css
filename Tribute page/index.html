        <h3>Here's a timeline of khalil Gibran's life</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1883</strong> Gibran is born in Besharri, a town in what is
            now northern Lebanon that is surrounded by the famed "Cedars of
            Lebanon".
          </li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>1895</strong> - After his father is imprisoned in Besharri
            for corruption,Gibran's mother and her four children emigrate to
            Boston in hopes of escaping misery. Kahlil shows talent at drawing
            and, at age 12, begins to learn English.
          </li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>1897</strong> - Moved by a desire to complete his
            Arabic-language education, Gibran returns to Lebanon and attends
            al-Hikmah high school in Beirut, where he pursues a reformist Arabic
            curriculum. He also studies religion and ethics.
          </li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>1902</strong>- Gibran returns to Boston, now aged 19.
            Develops a friendship, then romantic feelings for a young Bostonian
            woman, Josephine Peabody, a poet and intellectual. In the same year,
            he loses to tuberculosis his sister Sultana, his half-brother Peter,
            and his mother Kamila.
          </li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>1904</strong>- Meets Mary Haskell, an American school
            headmistress in Boston who supported promising young orphans. Marks
            the beginning of a lifelong friendship that sometimes veered toward
            romance. It is owing to Mary that he will be able to devote himself
            to his painting.
          </li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>1908</strong>- At 25 years of age, Gibran begins his
            two-year stay in Paris, paid for by Mary Haskell, where he studies
            painting and is influenced by the reigning school of Symbolism.
          </li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>1916</strong>- At age 33, Gibran's feelings of nationalism
            and resentment of Ottoman rule grow, as famine ravages the Levant.
            He becomes active in raising relief funds in the U.S. for the
            starving.
          </li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>1923</strong>- Appearance of The Prophet. Its lyricism and
            simple style make it an immediate and considerable success.
            Continues correspondence with May Ziadeh of Cairo. Mary Haskell
            moves to Savannah Georgia and goes out of Gibran's life.
          </li>
          <br />
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>1931</strong> - Gibran dies in a New York hospital. The New
            York Sun announces in its obituary, "A Prophet is Dead." His body is
            shipped back to Lebanon, and an immense procession follows his
            coffin from Beirut to Besharri.
